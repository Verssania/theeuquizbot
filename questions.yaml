  q: The founding countries decided to share control of their coal and steel industries so that they could not secretly arm themselves against each other. After this, they set about expanding cooperation to other economic sectors. What was the organisation they created in 1957 called?
  a:
    - The European Coal and Steel Community.
    - The European Economic and Social Committee.
    - correct: The European Economic Community.
  n: The European Economic Community was created by the Treaty of Rome, which was signed in the Italian capital on 25 March 1957.

  q: Soon after the Second World War, Europe was split into east and west. The Berlin Wall, which separated East and West Berlin for almost three decades, was a symbol of this division until its fall in 1989. Which of these statements is true?
  a:
    - The reunification of Germany in 1990 brought West Germany into the European Union.
    - Germany beat Argentina 1-0 in the 1990 football World Cup.
    - correct: Resistance against communist rule in central and eastern Europe led to the fall of the Berlin Wall.
  n: The collapse of communism across central and eastern Europe, which began in Poland and Hungary, was symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989. Germany was one of the founding members of the EU but it was West Germany that signed the first Treaty in 1951. When Germany was reunified in October 1990, it was therefore the former East Germany that became part of the European Union. It was West Germany that beat Argentina 1-0 to win the football World Cup in July 1990.  East and West Germany were not reunited as one country until 3 October that year.  Germany’s first football World Cup win as a unified nation was in 2014, when the team beat Argentina again 1-0.

  q: As well as being the capital of Belgium, Brussels is often referred to as the capital of Europe as this is where the main institutions are based. Which of the following statements is true?
  a:
    - The European Commission decides on all new EU laws and actions.
    - correct: The European Commission proposes new legislation while the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament make the final decision on all EU laws.
    - The European Council, made up of presidents and prime ministers of the EU countries, adopts EU laws.
  n: The European Commission drafts the proposals for new European laws. These are then discussed, amended and finally adopted   – or rejected   – by the Council of the EU (representing the governments of the EU countries) and the European Parliament (directly elected by EU citizens). This is the most common decision-making procedure in the EU. It is called the ordinary legislative procedure, also known as 'co-decision'.

  q: The European Commission is made up of one Commissioner per EU country. Together they make up the College of Commissioners. Which of these statements is true?

    - The Commissioners represent the views of their respective countries.
    - To be a Commissioner you first need to be a civil servant in your own country.
    - correct: Commissioners are proposed by their national governments and must be approved by the European Parliament.

Many Commissioners have previously been leading national politicians and are proposed by their government. The Presidential candidate selects potential Commissioners based on these suggestions. Each nominee must appear before the European Parliament to explain their vision and answer questions. Parliament then votes on whether to accept the nominees as a team. Finally, they are appointed by the European Council.

  n: EU citizens can vote every five years for who they want to represent them in the European Parliament. Parliamentary seats are divided between the individual member states according to the size of their population, which means that large countries have more Members of Parliament than small countries. The last European Parliament elections were held in spring 2019. The next elections will be held in 2024. You have the right to vote at 18 in all EU countries, except Austria and Malta, where you can vote at the age of 16, and Greece, where you can vote when you are 17.

  q: The Council of the European Union represents the governments of the EU countries. Ministers from all member states meet to discuss EU matters and make decisions on EU policies and laws. Which of these statements is true?
  a:
    - correct: Each minister in the Council votes on behalf of his or her own government.
    - Each EU country leads the work of the Council in turn for one year.
    - All decisions taken in the Council must be agreed unanimously.
  n: Ministers have the authority to commit their governments to the actions agreed on in meetings. If all member states had to agree on all decisions unanimously, not much would happen in the EU.  In many areas, ministers take decisions by majority vote.  They have agreed to keep unanimous voting in some sensitive areas, for example on taxation and security issues.

    - correct: If a national court is in doubt about the interpretation of an EU law, it can ask the Court of Justice for clarification.
    - In order to simplify its work, the languages used for all cases managed by the Court of Justice are only English, French and German.
  n: The Court of Justice is the highest legal authority in the EU and is based in Luxembourg. If a national court is in doubt about the interpretation or validity of an EU law, it can ask the Court for clarification. The same mechanism can be used to determine whether a national law or practice is compatible with EU law. Just as each member state has its own language and specific legal system, the Court of Justice is a multilingual institution. Its language arrangements have no equivalent in any other court in the world, since each of the official languages of the European Union can be the language of a case.

  q: European citizens can influence EU policies in a number of ways, for instance by launching or supporting a European citizens’ initiative. Which of these statements is true?

The first-ever European citizens’ initiative, ‘Right2Water’, which gathered 1.6 million signatures, led to a proposal for new rules on drinking water. Currently, in order to support an initiative, you must be eligible for voting in the European elections in your country (i.e. between 16 and 18 years old), but the Commission is working to lower this to 16 everywhere in the EU.

If working for the EU sounds like a career you might be interested in, then you could start as a trainee. Once you graduate from university, you can apply for an EU traineeship. This is however not a prerequisite for being recruited as Commission staff.
